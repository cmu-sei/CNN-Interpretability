This repo is intended to help users recover/reverse-engineer a trojan that's poisoned in a CNN model. FEUD uses **three main stages** and attempts to bring forward the most interpretable trigger features of the trojan. 
1. Trojan Estimator: General feature level Adv. Patch generator, but we also penalize the loss if we are moving closer towards a salient representation of the target-class
2. Trojan Description: We take our learned trigger and pass it through an img-to-txt interrogator (**CLIP Interrogator**) to get a feature description of the low quality trigger
3. Trojan Refinement: We take our learned trigger and best prompt and pass them through a img-to-img diffusion model (**OpenJourneyV4**)

## How to use
Upload 5 Salient Images to `./images/target_class/1.png , 2.png, 3.png, 4.png, 5.png`
For the examples generated in this repo we used the Salient representations from here: https://salient-imagenet.cs.umd.edu/explore

Set CUDA devices (if any)
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=...` \
\
Set command arguments:\
`model_path, type=pathlib.Path` location of poisoned/trojaned model \
`"-D", "--dataset", type=pathlib.Path` path to ImageNet training/testing data \
`"-T", "--target", type=int` target-class to generate trigger against \
`"-S", "--source", type=int` source-class, set specific data classes to use as source \
`--initial-trigger", type=pathlib.Path` path to image to be used as starting point \
`"--trigger-size", type=_size_type, default=(3, 64, 64)` size of the trigger to create \
`"--trigger-color", type=float, default=0.5)` starting pixel color for trigger (grey, black, white, random) \
`"-lr", "--learning-rate", type=float, default=4e-3)` learning rate for trigger \
`"-bs", "--batch-size", type=int, default=64)` configure batch size \
`"-I", "--num-iterations", type=int, default=128)` configure iterations \

`"--cpu"` flag to force cpu \
`"--debug"` debugging flag \
`"-o", "--output", type=pathlib.Path` location to save final trigger before diffusion \

Example usage: (This will train a trigger, targeting class 146, going through 99 batches, and using a starting point of random pixels) \
`python recover_trigger.py -T 146 -N 99 --trigger-color -0.1 /CNN-Interpretability/interp_trojan_resnet50_model.pt`
